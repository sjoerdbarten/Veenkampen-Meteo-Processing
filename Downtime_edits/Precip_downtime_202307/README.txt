Downtime precipitation sensor:

From 27-08-2023 to 31-08-2023 the precipitation sensor was broken by a vole (cables). The sensor submitted 0's to the logger instead of NaNs, so these had to be removed because it definitely rained (a lot) during this period.

The _orig data is the original data as uploaded to the databases (with 0s)
The _new data is the edited data (with NaNs)

The following data has been edited manually:
- 10min
- hour
- M
The following data has been edited with the edit_N_precip.py script:
- N

After editing the data has been uploaded to:
